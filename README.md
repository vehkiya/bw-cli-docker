# Bitwarden CLI Proxy & Webhook

This container image runs the [Bitwarden CLI](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients) (`bw`) and exposes its `serve` functionality through a proxy on port 8087. The proxy provides endpoints for health checks and manual synchronization, and automatically runs a periodic background sync to keep the vault up-to-date.

It is designed to be used as a webhook provider for the [External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/latest/) (ESO) in Kubernetes, allowing you to sync secrets from a self-hosted Vaultwarden or Bitwarden instance.

The entrypoint is a small Go program that handles the initial login and unlock flow, starts the `bw serve` process, runs a periodic sync task, and exposes everything through a reverse proxy.

## ‚ú® Security Highlights

This image is built with security as a top priority, adhering to modern best practices for containerization.

**Distroless**: The final image is built on a Google distroless base. It contains only the application and its runtime
dependencies. It does not include a shell, package manager, or other standard utilities, which dramatically reduces the
attack surface and eliminates a huge number of potential CVEs.

**Rootless**: The container process runs as a non-privileged nonroot user by default. This prevents a whole class of
container-breakout vulnerabilities and ensures that even if the application were compromised, the attacker would not
have root access within the container.

## üöÄ Usage

This image is intended to be run as a service inside a Kubernetes cluster.

### Kubernetes Manifest
Here is an example Deployment that uses this image and exposes it as a service for ESO.

### API Endpoints

The proxy server provides the following endpoints:

#### `GET /healthz`

A simple health check endpoint. It returns a `200 OK` status if the proxy server is running. This is suitable for use in Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes.

#### `POST /sync`

This endpoint triggers a `bw sync` command to manually synchronize the vault with the Bitwarden server. This is useful to force an update after making changes to your vault. This endpoint is also called automatically in the background on a periodic basis.

#### `/*`

All other requests are proxied directly to the `bw serve` process. This is how the External Secrets Operator will interact with the Bitwarden vault.
