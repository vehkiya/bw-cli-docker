# Bitwarden CLI Webhook

This container image runs the Bitwarden CLI (`bw`) and exposes it as a simple REST API webhook on port 8087. It is
designed to be used as a webhook provider for the [External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/latest/) (ESO)
in Kubernetes, allowing you to sync secrets from a self-hosted Vaultwarden instance.

The entrypoint is a small Go program that handles the login and unlock flow before starting the bw serve process.

## ‚ú® Security Highlights

This image is built with security as a top priority, adhering to modern best practices for containerization.

**Distroless**: The final image is built on a Google distroless base. It contains only the application and its runtime
dependencies. It does not include a shell, package manager, or other standard utilities, which dramatically reduces the
attack surface and eliminates a huge number of potential CVEs.

**Rootless**: The container process runs as a non-privileged nonroot user by default. This prevents a whole class of
container-breakout vulnerabilities and ensures that even if the application were compromised, the attacker would not
have root access within the container.

## üöÄ Usage

This image is intended to be run as a service inside a Kubernetes cluster.
